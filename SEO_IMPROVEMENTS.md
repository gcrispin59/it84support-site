# IT84Support SEO + Engagement Improvements

This document reviews the current site and suggests improvements to increase SEO and Google ranking, with wording targeted at small businesses (fewer than 25 employees) in professional and trade services.

## High-impact SEO additions (recommended)

- Add a dedicated business services headline and description for the target audience.
- Add structured data (LocalBusiness + Service + FAQ).
- Add a “Service Areas” section (suburbs/regions) to increase local SEO.
- Add a testimonials section (even 2–3 short quotes).
- Add a “FAQs for small teams” section to target long-tail search.
- Create a `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`.
- Add `meta` tags for social sharing (Open Graph/Twitter).
- Add internal links to service detail pages from the hero and results section.

## Suggested navigation improvements (including dropdown)

Current nav is flat. For clarity and better crawl depth, add a “Services” dropdown with the four service pages, plus a “Resources” dropdown for Security/RSS/Blog.

**Example nav structure**

- Home
- Services
  - Cloud Services & Secure AI
  - Computer Systems Maintenance
  - Custom Builds & Upgrades
  - Operating System Installation
- Results
- Security
- Resources
  - RSS Feeds
  - Microsoft 365 Updates
  - Practical365
- Contact
- Booking

**Why this helps SEO**

- Clear keyword grouping improves topical authority.
- Dropdown links increase internal link depth and improve crawlability.

## Suggested hero text (small business focus)

Replace the hero block with messaging that targets professional and trade services with fewer than 25 employees.

**Proposed H1**

Small-business IT support for teams under 25 employees

**Proposed hero paragraph**

IT84 Support helps owner‑operators, partnerships, and small professional or trade teams keep systems secure, reliable, and fast. We provide practical, fixed‑scope IT services without enterprise complexity.

**Proposed CTA text**

- Primary: “Book a small‑business IT consult”
- Secondary: “Talk to a technician”

## Suggested description text (meta + page intro)

The current meta description is generic. Expand it with local and small‑business intent.

**Proposed meta description**

IT84 Support delivers small‑business IT for teams under 25 employees. Cloud, maintenance, security, and upgrades for owner‑operators and partnerships across Australia.

**Proposed intro (first paragraph after H1)**

We specialise in practical IT support for small businesses—owner‑operators, partnerships, and teams under 25 staff. From cloud and security to reliable on‑site hardware, we keep your business running with minimal downtime.

## Content expansions to increase keyword coverage

### Add a “Who We Help” section

Include industries that align to B2B and trades:

- Accountants and bookkeepers
- Builders, electricians, plumbers, and trades
- Medical and allied health clinics
- Consultants and professional services
- Real estate and property services

### Add a “Why IT84” section

Short bullets for trust and conversion:

- Small‑business first (no enterprise overhead)
- Plain‑English advice
- Fixed‑scope projects and flexible support
- Remote‑first support with on‑site when needed

## Local SEO recommendations

- Add a visible address or service area list.
- Include an ABN (if available) for trust.
- Add a Google Business Profile link.
- Add `LocalBusiness` schema with service areas.

## Technical SEO suggestions

- Add `rel="canonical"` to the home page.
- Add `lang="en-AU"` to the HTML tag.
- Ensure all images have descriptive `alt` text with service keywords.
- Add `preload` for the logo and hero images to improve LCP.

## RSS/Resources improvements

- Add a short intro above the ticker: “Live security alerts for small teams.”
- Add a “Show latest alerts” button that scrolls to the ticker.
- Consider a lightweight cache or serverless proxy later for faster RSS fetches.

## Proposed new sections and copy (ready to insert)

**Section: Who We Help**

We work with small, owner‑managed businesses and partnership‑run firms—typically under 25 staff—who need reliable IT without enterprise complexity. If you’re in professional services or trade services, we’ll tailor a practical plan that keeps your team productive.

**Section: Service Areas**

Adelaide metro, Hills & Surrounds, and remote support across Australia.  
(Replace with the exact service area list you want.)

**Section: Small Business FAQs**

- Do you support businesses under 25 staff?
- Can you manage Microsoft 365 and business email?
- Do you provide fixed‑price IT projects?
- How fast can you respond to urgent issues?

## Additional feed suggestions (optional)

If you want more AU‑focused feeds:

- Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) advisories
- OAIC (privacy breach guidance)
- Australian Cyber Security Magazine

## Next steps (if you want me to implement)

- Add the new sections and update the hero + meta description.
- Implement dropdown navigation and add structured data.
- Add `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, and social meta tags.
