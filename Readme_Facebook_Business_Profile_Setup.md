# Facebook Business Profile (Page) setup for IT84 Support

Steps to create a **Facebook Page** for IT84 Support so the business has a presence on Facebook and you can link it from the website. A Page is the public “business profile”; you can manage it from a personal Facebook account or via Meta Business Suite.

---

## 1. Create a Facebook Page

1. Go to [facebook.com/pages/create](https://www.facebook.com/pages/create) (or **Menu** → **Pages** → **Create**).
2. Sign in with the **personal Facebook account** that will manage the Page (or create one). This account is the Page admin; you can add more admins later.
3. Choose **Business or Brand** as the Page type.
4. Enter **Page name** (e.g. **IT84 Support**).
5. Choose a **Category** (e.g. *IT Services and IT Consulting*, or *Computer Support and Services*). This helps people find you.
6. Enter a short **Description** (e.g. IT support, Microsoft 365, consulting — regions served).
7. Add **Profile picture** (logo) and **Cover photo** (recommended size 820×312 px). Use the same logo as on the website for consistency.
8. Click **Create Page**.

## 2. Add business details

1. In the Page, go to **Edit Page** (or **Page settings** / the pencil icon on the profile).
2. Fill in:
   - **About**: Full description, website URL (e.g. `https://it84support.com.au` or current site), and **Contact** (phone, email such as samuel@it84.com.au).
   - **Location**: Add business address if you have a physical location; otherwise leave blank or set service area in the description.
   - **Hours**: Set if relevant (e.g. “By appointment” or business hours).
   - **More**: Add **Services** (e.g. Microsoft 365 support, on-site support, consulting) and any **Action button** (e.g. “Contact us”, “Call now”, “Visit website”).
3. Save changes.

## 3. Optional: Create a Meta Business Account

If you plan to run ads or manage multiple assets (Page, Instagram, etc.):

1. Go to [business.facebook.com](https://business.facebook.com) and sign in with your Facebook account.
2. Create or select a **Business Account** (e.g. “IT84 Support”).
3. **Add assets**: Link the Facebook Page you created so it appears under this business.
4. You can add more people as **Business admins** or **Page admins** with different permissions.

For a simple “business profile” and link on the website, the Page alone is enough; Business Suite is optional.

## 4. Delegate Editor role to graham@grahamcrispin.com

To let **graham@grahamcrispin.com** edit the Page (posts, info, responses) without full admin rights:

1. Open your **Facebook Page** and go to **Page settings** (gear icon or **Settings** in the left menu).
2. In the left column, click **Page access** (or **Page roles** in older UI).
3. Under **People with Facebook access** (or **Assign Page roles**), click **Add people**.
4. Enter **graham@grahamcrispin.com** (or the Facebook account email Graham uses).
5. Set the role to **Editor**.
   - **Editor** can: create and delete posts, respond to comments and messages, edit Page info and settings, create ads. Cannot: remove admins, assign roles, or delete the Page.
6. Click **Add**. Graham will receive an invitation and must accept it to get access.

**Note:** Graham must have a Facebook account linked to that email. If the invite does not arrive, confirm the email and check spam; alternatively add by name if Graham has already liked or followed the Page.

## 5. Get the Page URL and add to the website

1. Open your **Facebook Page**.
2. Copy the **Page URL** from the browser (e.g. `https://www.facebook.com/IT84Support` or the custom username you set).
3. **Custom username** (optional): In **Page settings** → **Page identity** → **Username**, set a short name (e.g. `IT84Support`) so the URL is easy to share.
4. In this project, add the Facebook Page link where appropriate (e.g. footer or contact section in **index.html**, or a “Follow us on Facebook” button).
5. Redeploy the site after updating the link.

## 6. Ongoing use

- **Posts**: Share updates, tips, or offers to keep the Page active (helps visibility).
- **Messages**: Turn on **Messenger** in Page settings if you want customers to message you; check and reply from the Page or Meta Business Suite.
- **Reviews**: If you enable reviews, respond to them to build trust.
- **Insights**: Use **Page insights** (or Meta Business Suite) to see reach and engagement.
